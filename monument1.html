      The Pyramids of Giza, located on the Giza Plateau just outside Cairo, Egypt, are among the most iconic and enduring monuments in human history. Constructed during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, around 2600 BC, these massive stone structures were built as tombs for the pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. The largest, the Great Pyramid of Khufu, originally stood over 146 meters tall and was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years.

      The engineering techniques used to build the pyramids remain a subject of fascination and debate. Millions of limestone blocks were transported and precisely placed to form structures that align almost perfectly with the cardinal points and celestial bodies. This precision reflects the advanced knowledge of mathematics and astronomy possessed by the ancient Egyptians. Beyond their architectural brilliance, the pyramids symbolize the religious and cultural beliefs of a civilization that placed immense importance on the afterlife. They were designed not only as tombs but as gateways to eternity, filled with passages, chambers, and treasures meant to accompany the pharaohs on their journey.

      Today, the Pyramids of Giza are recognized as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and remain a UNESCO World Heritage Site. They attract millions of visitors each year, standing as a testament to human ingenuity and the enduring legacy of ancient Egypt.

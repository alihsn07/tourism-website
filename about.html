  <h2>Student & Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
   This website was created by a student as part of a university assignment in web development. The goal of the project was to design a small yet professional-looking website that highlights some of the most famous monuments in the world. It combines technical practice with creative storytelling, allowing the student to demonstrate skills in coding, design, and content writing. While the site is not intended to be a comprehensive academic resource, it reflects a clear effort to present information in an accessible, organized, and visually engaging way.

The purpose of the project is twofold. First, it serves as a practical exercise in building a multi-page website using modern front-end technologies. Each page is carefully structured to include headings, images, descriptive text, and intuitive navigation. Second, the project aims to celebrate global cultural heritage by presenting monuments such as the Pyramids of Giza, the Colosseum, the Taj Mahal, Petra, the Great Wall of China, and Borobudur. By combining historical context with visual design, the website encourages visitors to appreciate the importance of these landmarks while showcasing the student’s ability to organize and present content effectively.

The tools used in this project include HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling and responsive layouts, and JavaScript for interactivity and animations. Features such as smooth scrolling, slide-in effects, and basic form validation were implemented to enhance the user experience. A dark-themed design was chosen to give the website a modern and elegant aesthetic. Overall, the project demonstrates how technical skills and creativity can be combined to produce a website that is both educational and engaging.

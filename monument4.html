      Petra, often called the “Rose City” because of the pink sandstone cliffs, is one of the most extraordinary archaeological sites in the world. Carved into rock by the Nabataeans around the 4th century BC, Petra served as a thriving trade hub linking Arabia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean. Its most famous monument, Al-Khazneh (The Treasury), is a stunning façade carved directly into the cliff, blending Hellenistic and Eastern architectural styles.

      Beyond The Treasury, Petra contains tombs, temples, and an intricate water management system that sustained life in the arid desert. The city's hidden location, accessible through the narrow Siq canyon, added to its mystique and defensive strength. Rediscovered by Western explorers in the 19th century, Petra has since become a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Today, visitors walk through the Siq to marvel at its monuments, experiencing the ingenuity and artistry of the Nabataean civilization.

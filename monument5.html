      The Great Wall of China is the longest man0made structure in the world, stretching more than 21,000 kilometers across northern China. Construction began as early as the 7th century BC, but most of the existing sections were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The wall was designed to protect Chinese states from invasions and raids, serving as both a military defense and a symbol of unity.

      The wall is not a single continuous structure but a series of walls, fortresses, and watchtowers winding through mountains, deserts, and plains. Its construction required immense labor, with soldiers, peasants, and prisoners contributing to the effort. Today, the Great Wall stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a powerful symbol of China's resilience and ingenuity. Millions of visitors walk along its restored sections, experiencing firsthand the scale and ambition of this ancient project.

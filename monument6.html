    <p>
      Borobudur, located in Central Java, Indonesia, is the largest Buddhist temple in the world. Built in the 9th century during the Sailendra Dynasty, it is designed as a massive mandala representing Buddhist cosmology. The monument consists of nine stacked platforms topped by a central dome, surrounded by 72 stupas each containing a statue of Buddha.

      The temple's walls are adorned with over 2,600 relief panels depicting Buddhist teachings and daily life in ancient Java. Pilgrims walk through its terraces in a clockwise direction, symbolizing a spiritual journey from the earthly realm to enlightenment. Abandoned for centuries and later rediscovered, Borobudur has been restored and is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It remains both a place of pilgrimage and a symbol of Indonesia's cultural heritage, attracting visitors from around the globe.
